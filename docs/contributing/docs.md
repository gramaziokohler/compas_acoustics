# Contributing to the documentation

The documentation is built with MkDocs. Most pages are written by hand; the Grasshopper component reference and the
example pages are generated from the plugin and from `examples/`, and their images are made offline and committed.
The build checks that those images still match their sources and fails, with instructions, when they do not.

## Build the documentation

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
invoke docs
```

`invoke docs` first runs `invoke docs-components` (which generates the pages and runs the checks), then builds the
HTML into `dist/docs`. A plain `mkdocs build` (or `mkdocs serve`) and the CI build run the same generator, through the
hook in `docs/_ext/mkdocs_hooks.py`. The CI builds with `--strict`: a warning, such as a broken link, fails it.

## What is generated, and from what

The generator is `docs/_ext/ghcomponents`. It writes three folders, which git ignores; edit their sources instead.

| Generated | Sources |
|---|---|
| `docs/grasshopper/components/` | `src/compas_acoustics_ghcsharp/CompasAcoustics.Grasshopper/Components/Specs/<CA_name>/metadata.json` and `icon.png`; the panel order from `ComponentBase.Subcategories` in `ComponentBase.cs`; the GUIDs from the C# classes; `docs/grasshopper/python_equivalents.json`; `docs/grasshopper/notes/<CA_name>.md`; `docs/_images/components/<CA_name>.png`; `docs/_images/icons/<CA_name>.png`, each icon at four times the size, which the pages use instead of `icon.png` |
| `docs/python/examples/` | `examples/<name>.py` (its docstring gives the title and paragraph) and `docs/_images/examples/<name>/` (`figure_<n>.png`, `viewer_<n>.png`, `stdout.txt`) |
| `docs/grasshopper/examples/` | `examples/<name>.ghx`, `docs/grasshopper/walkthroughs/<name>.md` and `docs/_images/examples/<name>/` (`canvas.png`, `viewport.png`) |

`docs/_images/fingerprints.json` records what each image was made from: the port names of each component, and a
hash of each example file. The checks compare it with the sources.

## Make the images

Grasshopper images
:   Need Rhino 8 with the current plugin installed (`invoke installer-bundle`, then run the installer). Open
    Rhino 8 and Grasshopper, open `docs/_tools/capture_grasshopper.py` in Rhino's ScriptEditor and run it. It
    captures what is missing or out of date (component screenshots, and the canvas and viewport of each `.ghx`)
    and updates the fingerprints. Set `ALL = True` at the top of the script to capture everything.

Component icons
:   `tools/icons.py` draws them. After a change to an icon, run `python tools/icons.py`: it writes the plugin's
    `icon.png` and the large copy in `docs/_images/icons/`. `tests/test_icons.py` fails when either is out of date.

Python example outputs
:   Run `invoke docs-images`. It runs each example whose output is missing or out of date and saves the figures it
    shows, what it prints, and a capture of each COMPAS viewer it opens (the viewer window opens for a moment, so
    run it on a computer with a display). `invoke docs-images --all` runs every example.

Commit `docs/_images/` with the change that needed new images.

## When the build fails

Each failure names what is wrong and how to fix it. The sections below repeat the fix for each kind.

### Component screenshots are out of date { #screenshots }

A component has no screenshot, or its ports changed since the screenshot was taken (the message names the ports
added or removed). Make the Grasshopper images as above and commit `docs/_images/`.

### Grasshopper example images are out of date { #example-images }

A `.ghx` example is new or changed since its canvas and viewport were captured. Make the Grasshopper images as
above, check that its walkthrough still describes it, and commit `docs/_images/`.

### Python example outputs are out of date { #example-outputs }

An example script is new or changed since its output was saved. Run `invoke docs-images` and commit
`docs/_images/`.

### A component is in an unknown panel { #subcategories }

A component's `subcategory` in its `metadata.json` is not in `ComponentBase.Subcategories` in
`src/compas_acoustics_ghcsharp/CompasAcoustics.Grasshopper/Components/ComponentBase.cs`. Add it there, where its
place in the list sets its place in the ribbon and in the docs.

### A component has no Python equivalent entry { #python-equivalents }

Every component needs an entry in `docs/grasshopper/python_equivalents.json`: the dotted path of the
`compas_acoustics` class or function it corresponds to, or `null` for a component that exists only in
Grasshopper.

### A Python example has no docstring { #example-docstrings }

Start the script with a docstring: a one-line title, a blank line, then a paragraph on what it shows. The page takes
its title and introduction from it.

### A Grasshopper example has no walkthrough { #walkthroughs }

Write `docs/grasshopper/walkthroughs/<name>.md`: the page title on the first line, a blank line, a paragraph on what
the definition does, a blank line, then one numbered step per group of the definition. Link components relative to
the generated page, for example `[Source](../components/CA_Source.md)`.

## Add an example

A Python example
:   Add `examples/<name>.py` with a docstring, run `invoke docs-images`, and commit the script and
    `docs/_images/`.

A Grasshopper example
:   Save the definition as `examples/<name>.ghx` (XML, so that git can diff it), with each stage in a labelled
    group. Write its walkthrough, make the Grasshopper images, and commit the three.

The two lists grow independently. When a `.py` and a `.ghx` share a name, their pages link to each other.

## Component notes and Python equivalents

To add text to a component's page beyond its description, write `docs/grasshopper/notes/<CA_name>.md`; it appears
under *Notes*. Link other components relative to the generated page, as in a walkthrough. The component descriptions
themselves live in its `metadata.json`, which the plugin also shows.

## Before a release

1. `invoke docs-images --all`: a library change can alter a figure without changing the script.
2. Run `capture_grasshopper.py` with `ALL = True`, for the same reason.
3. `mkdocs build --strict` and read the changed pages.
