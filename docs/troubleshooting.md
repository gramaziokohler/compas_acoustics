# Troubleshooting

Each entry gives the symptom, its usual cause and the fix. When none fits, open the worker log (right-click any
component, **Open worker log**) and [report an issue](https://github.com/gramaziokohler/compas_acoustics/issues)
with the log, your operating system and the Rhino version.

## The worker does not start

**Symptom:** components stay red with *The worker at ... could not be started*, *exited while starting* or *did not
answer within ... s*.

**Cause:** the worker's Python environment is missing or broken, often after an interrupted first installation
(it downloads several GB), or something blocks local connections on `127.0.0.1`.

**Fix:** run the installer again and wait until it says *Restart Rhino*; restart Rhino. Check that a firewall or
security tool allows Rhino's local connections. The log names the Python it tried to start.

## "Run the installer again"

**Symptom:** *is not this version's*, *runs compas_acoustics <version>* or *schema mismatch: run the installer again*.

**Cause:** the plugin and the worker come from different releases, for example after updating only one of them, or
`COMPAS_ACOUSTICS_WORKER_PYTHON` points at an environment with another version.

**Fix:** run the installer of the release you want, then restart Rhino. If you set
`COMPAS_ACOUSTICS_WORKER_PYTHON`, install the same `compas_acoustics` version there or unset it.

## Binaural or Ambisonics is missing in Python

**Symptom:** `ca.Binaural` or `ca.Ambisonics` raises `ImportError: ... needs Python >= 3.11`.

**Cause:** they need Python 3.11 or newer (pyFDN, spharpy and multislope); on 3.9 and 3.10, Rhino 8's Python among
them, `compas_acoustics` leaves them out.

**Fix:** use an environment with Python 3.11 or newer. In Grasshopper the Simulate Binaural and Simulate Ambisonics
components work anyway: they run in the worker, which has Python 3.12.

## macOS blocks the plugin

**Symptom:** Grasshopper does not load `CompasAcoustics.gha`, or macOS says the file cannot be checked.

**Cause:** files downloaded from the internet carry the quarantine attribute.

**Fix:** remove it from the plugin folder (Grasshopper: *File > Special Folders > Components Folder*), then restart
Rhino:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "<Components Folder>/compas_acoustics"
```

## Windows blocks the plugin

**Symptom:** Grasshopper reports the plugin as blocked.

**Fix:** in the Components Folder, right-click each file of `compas_acoustics`, choose *Properties* and tick
*Unblock*; restart Rhino.

## Old components appear next to the new ones

**Symptom:** an older version of a component (for example an Audio Player) appears, or Grasshopper reports a
component ID conflict.

**Cause:** a copy installed another way: an old Yak package from the Package Manager, CPython components
(`.ghuser`) of an earlier version in UserObjects, or a developer build folder listed in Grasshopper's settings.

**Fix:** uninstall `compas_acoustics` in Rhino's Package Manager if it is listed there, delete
`compas_acoustics` files from *File > Special Folders > User Object Folder*, remove extra folders listed by Rhino's
`GrasshopperDeveloperSettings` command, and restart Rhino. The installer
removes the old `.ghuser` components itself.

## Where the logs are

* The worker's log: right-click any component, **Open worker log**. It is a temporary file named
  `compas_acoustics_worker_<process>.log`, one per Rhino session.
* The installer's log: the `log` output of the installer component.
* The worker's environment: `~/.compas_acoustics/worker.json` names its Python.
