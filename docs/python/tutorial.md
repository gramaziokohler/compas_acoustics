# Tutorial

This tutorial builds a room, simulates its impulse responses, analyses them and
listens to the result. Every step uses the classes of [`compas_acoustics`](../api/compas_acoustics.md).

## Build a scene

A [`Scene`][compas_acoustics.Scene] holds the room's surfaces, the sources and
the receivers. A shoebox room is six surfaces, each an
[`AcousticObject`][compas_acoustics.AcousticObject] with its own material.

```python
import compas_acoustics as ca

scene = ca.Scene("room")
scene.add_source(ca.Source("talker", 2, 2, 1.6))
scene.add_receiver(ca.Receiver("listener", 6, 4, 1.2, direction=[-1, -0.5, 0]))
```

A room drawn in Rhino can be read from an OBJ file instead, one object per OBJ
group (Rhino layer): `ca.AcousticObject.from_obj(path, materials={...})`.
`examples/obj.py` does this for a room with a table in it.

## Materials

Materials have absorption and scattering coefficients in seven octave bands,
125 Hz to 8 kHz. Take them from the library, or define your own.

```python
library = ca.MaterialsLibrary()
carpet = library.material_from_name("carpet")
plaster = ca.AcousticMaterial("plaster", absorption_coefficients=0.05, scattering_coefficients=0.1)

room = ca.AcousticObjectsLibrary.shoebox_room(8, 6, 3, materials={
    "floor": carpet,
    "ceiling": plaster,
    "left_wall": plaster,
    "right_wall": plaster,
    "front_wall": plaster,
    "back_wall": plaster,
})
scene.add_acoustic_objects(room)
```

## Simulate

Every simulation method runs through `scene.simulate`, which returns one
[`ImpulseResponse`][compas_acoustics.ImpulseResponse] per source-receiver pair.
[`Mono`][compas_acoustics.Mono] uses image sources and ray tracing;
[`Binaural`][compas_acoustics.Binaural] and [`Ambisonics`][compas_acoustics.Ambisonics]
use the hybrid engine and need Python 3.11 or newer.

```python
mono = scene.simulate(ca.Mono(ray_tracing=True, n_rays=5000))
binaural = scene.simulate(ca.Binaural())
ambisonics = scene.simulate(ca.Ambisonics(sh_order=1))
```

## Analyse

[`Analyser`][compas_acoustics.Analyser] derives the room acoustic parameters of
ISO 3382 from a response: reverberation times, clarity, definition and more,
per octave band.

```python
(ir,) = mono.values()
analyser = ca.Analyser(ir)
results = analyser.analyse()
analyser.print_table()
```

## Auralise

[`Auraliser`][compas_acoustics.Auraliser] convolves the responses with an anechoic
recording, in the format of the responses: here binaural, for headphones.

```python
speech = ca.Defaults().ANECHOIC_SOUNDFILES_LIBRARY_PATH + "/female_speech.wav"
signal = ca.Auraliser("room", list(binaural.values()), anechoic_sounds=[speech]).convolve()
```

Ambisonic responses are convolved the same way and give an ambisonic (AmbiX)
signal, to save as a multichannel file for a decoder elsewhere.

## Grasshopper

The Grasshopper plugin has a component for each of these steps, in the panels
`Elements` to `Optimization` of the COMPAS Acoustics category. Install it with the
installer bundle (see [Install in Rhino 8 and Grasshopper](../installation/grasshopper.md)); the components run
everything in a Python worker that starts with the first component that needs it.
