"""Direction-dependent boundary absorption on the delay line outputs.

Wendt, van de Par and Ewert (2014, Sec. 1.2) weight "the signal of each incidence direction ... with the
reflection coefficient of the room wall corresponding to the respective parallel cube side face". Kirsch, Wendt
and van de Par (2023, Sec. 1.3, Eqs. 4-5) generalise it to arbitrary geometry, which holds for a mesh: rays from
the receiver sample the absorption of the first face they meet, and each line takes a weighted mean,

    w_s,k = max(v_s . v_k, 0) ** beta,   beta = K / 6,
    a_k   = sum_s w_s,k alpha_s / sum_s w_s,k,

``v_s`` the scanned directions, ``v_k`` the line's, ``K`` the number of lines (a -3 dB lobe of 90 degrees at six).
The line's output filter has the magnitude ``sqrt(1 - a_k)`` per band. It sits outside the loop, so every line
still decays at ``target.rt``; the late field loses one reflection's absorption, ``10 log10(mean_k (1 - a_k))``
dB, left uncompensated as in both papers.
