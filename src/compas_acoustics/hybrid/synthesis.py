    """The format-neutral part of the hybrid for one pair: its early paths and its delay lines.

    After Wendt, van de Par and Ewert (2014) and Kirsch et al. (2021, 2023):

    1. Images up to ``max_order`` (with ``diffraction``, diffracted paths too) are the early field, kept path by
       path; higher orders in ``iss`` are ignored.
    2. An FDN with one delay line per direction of an equal-area grid of ``num_delays`` points (:func:`fdn_directions`), attenuation
       following ``target.rt``, each line the room's free path along its direction (:func:`directional_delays`).
    3. The images of order ``max_order`` also enter the network, each spread over the lines of the hemisphere
       opposite its arrival by the cosine to each line (:func:`~compas_acoustics.hybrid.scattering.scattering_weights`
       with ``opposite``; Ewert et al. 2025, Sec. 3.1.2), so the first output is the next order, one free path
       later, off the far side: the input "must equal the total energy of the Nth-order reflections" (Wendt et
       al. 2014, Sec. 1.3).
    4. Each line is weighted with the reflection of the boundary in its direction (``directional_absorption``).
       The lines are kept with ``line_directions`` for the renderer.

    ``duration_s`` defaults to 1.5 times the longest target RT. ``rng`` seeds the delay jitter and the feedback
    matrices, ``rng + slope`` for each slope. ``drive_gain`` defaults to ``sqrt(num_delays)``. ``late_envelope``, a package-scale omnidirectional reference,
    attenuates the lines per band to its late energy (Vorlaender 2020, Sec. 11.9); ``directional_envelope``, a
    :class:`~compas_acoustics.room.raytracing.DirectionalHistogram` on the lines' directions in room coordinates,
    then gives them the rays' distribution (:func:`~compas_acoustics.hybrid.envelope.shape_late_directional`);
    the renderer applies both (:meth:`HybridCore.shaped_lines`).

    ``diffraction="udfa"`` (``True``) adds edge diffraction (Kirsch and Ewert 2023) around obstacles and at room
    edges wider than pi (:func:`~compas_acoustics.hybrid.diffraction.diffraction_edges`), for the direct sound and,
    when ``max_order >= 1``, one enclosure reflection before or after the edge. ``"btms"`` renders first- and
    second-order diffraction with the BTMS model (Svensson et al. 1999), first order with at most one wall
    reflection, second order between visible edges, direct paths only; it is far slower than ``"udfa"``. The
    late field is not affected.

    ``scattering`` (Ewert et al. 2025) needs ``iss.scattered``; the gains are then the specular parts. The
    scattered part of every image of orders 1 to ``max_order`` enters "those FDN channels on the same hemisphere
    (initially skipping the FDN delays ...)" (Sec. 3.1.2), smeared by the allpass cascade of Eqs. 12-13 with
    ``R`` the mean free path and weighted by :func:`~compas_acoustics.hybrid.scattering.scattering_weights` (unit
    l2 norm, as one driving image) times ``drive_gain``, as :func:`render`'s ``tap``.
